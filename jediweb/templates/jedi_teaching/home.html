    <h4>Machine Teaching</h4>
    <p> This is an automated system to teach you how to classify a set of images.</p>
    <p>There are two stages:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>The computer will teach you what the images look like.</li>
        <li>The computer will test you on your recognition ability.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>After clicking Start, you will enter the Teaching Stage. Here, you will be shown a sequence of images. For each
        image, select your best estimate of its label. You will then be given feedback on your answer. At the start, you
        will have to guess, but over time you should learn from the computer's feedback. After the Teaching Stage has
        finished, you will enter the Testing Stage. </p>
