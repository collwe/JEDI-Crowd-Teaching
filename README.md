-- Yao Zhou, Arun Reddy Nelakurthi, Jingrui He

### Introduction
We propose an adaptive teaching framework named JEDI to construct the personalized optimal teaching set for crowdsourcing workers. 

### Content
- Matlab implementation of JEDI with harmonic function estimation.
- Django/Python implementation of the JEDI adaptive web interface for real human learners.

### Demo
- The demo of JEDI teaching for real human learners can be found here:
