%% Using cmu.units in Matlab

%% Load the units package
% units is a new type of object in Matlab that stores the units, enforces 
% proper unit algebra and works with most mathematical operations in 
% Matlab. You load the units package into a variable; by convention: u
% the default set of base units are the SI units.
u = cmu.units;

%% Simple unit algebra
% the basics of unit algebra are that like units can be added and
% subtracted. Unlike units can be multiplied and divided.
% when you assign a unit to a number, it is automatically converted into
% the base units. 
5*u.kg % a mass
5*u.lb % another mass
6*u.m/u.s  % a velocity

1*u.m + 10*u.cm % this is ok, 1.1 m
% 1*u.m + 1*u.s  % this is not ok

%% Temperature is a little special
% most unit conversions are simple multiplications. Temperature conversions
% involve multiplication and an offset; e.g. F = C*9/5 + 32;

T = 298*u.K    % Kelvin is an absolute scale
Tf = 400*u.R   % Rankine is an absolute scale
T1 = u.degC(100) % this is 100 degC, and T1 is in Kelvin
T2 = u.degF(212) % this is 212 degF, and T2 is in Kelvin

% convert 32 degF to degC
u.degF2C(32)  %no units on the output
u.degC2F(100) %no units on the output

%% displaying units 
% a unit object has an "as" function that can display the unit in various
% forms
a = 1*u.kg;
a.as(u.lb)

% to do an actual conversion, you divide the unit by the units you want to
% convert to.
sprintf('%1.2f = %1.2f lb',a,a/u.lb)

%% Load the cmu.constants package
% The gas constant, speed of light, etc... are stored in this package
clear all; u = cmu.units;
c = cmu.constants;
c.R  %the gas constant%% variations of the gas constant
c.R.as(u.J/u.mol/u.K)
c.R.as(u.J/(u.mol*u.K))
c.R.as(u.cal/u.mol/u.K)
c.R.as(u.dm^3*u.atm/u.mol/u.K)
c.R.as(u.BTU/u.lbmol/u.R)
c.R.as(u.ft^3*u.atm/(u.lbmol*u.R))

%% Arrays of units
t = [0 1 2 3 4]*u.s;
C = [5 3 1 0.5 0.05]*u.mol/u.L; % note these concentrations are stored 
                                % internally as mol/m^3 because those are 
                                % the base SI units

% we can change the units in a plot by converting them to the units we want
plot(t/u.min,C/(u.mol/u.L))
xlabel('Time (min)')
ylabel('Concentration (mol/L)')

%% units with Matlab functions
% Many functions in Matlab such as ode45, ode15s, fzero, fsolve, min, max,
% etc... work with units. This works because we have overloaded these 
% functions to work with units. Not all functions are overloaded though, so
% be careful! If you find you have lost the units, it means you used a
% function that was not overloaded. Please let us know about it!
%
% little example of integrating an ode
k = 0.3/u.min;
dCadt = @(t,Ca) -k*Ca;
Cao = 1*u.mol/u.L;
tspan = [0 10]*u.min;
[t,Ca] = ode45(dCadt, tspan, Cao);
plot(t,Ca/(u.mol/u.L),'ko-') %default units for Ca are mol/m^3!
xlabel('Time(sec)')
ylabel('Ca (mol/L)')

%% functions that do not work with units
% functions that require dimensionless arguments (e.g. trig functions, exp,
% log, etc...) will usually fail if you pass a unit in. You must divide the
% arguments by the appropriate units to make them dimensionless
a = 5*u.mol;
sin(a/u.mol)

%% Alternative base units
% you can specify 'SI', 'CGS' or 'American' as the base units
% SI/MKS: {'m','s','kg', 'K', 'mol','coul','candela'}
% CGS: {'cm','s','gm','K', 'mol','coul','candela'}
% American: {'in','s','lb','R', 'mol','coul','candela'}

u = cmu.units('American');
a = 2*u.ft
a.as(u.m)

% you can also specify which units are your base. Note the order of base
% units must be: length, time, mass, temperature, charge, mol
% and all of them must be specified.
u = cmu.units('mm','min','ton','R','coul','mol','candela');
a = u.cm
a.as(u.m)

%% simplified units
% there may be times when you need units conversion, but you only want
% simple numbers and not unit objects, e.g. because some Matlab function 
% doesn't handle units.
% You can load the simple_units structure to get a set of conversion
% factors. Unit algebra is not used and units are kept track of, so you
% have to know what the units are.
u = cmu.unit.simple_units;
a = 1*u.kg
a/u.lb
a/u.min
